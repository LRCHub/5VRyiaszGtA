I will lock on love, I will lock on love
I will lock on love, I will lock on love

Don't go away, there's nowhere else to run
I know that's what we want, I know it's a war we want
So raise your guns, come on, let's have some fun
I know that's what we want, I know it's a war we want

Coming up, coming up
The eyes that only see prey
An instinct to act on the bloodlust
And it's just not enough, not enough
But that's the chain of command
And now we know we must not hide

We honor the jingos, oh
And the beast we unleash to indulge in our desires
We are in the jungle, oh
With our claws, a killing spree
With our fangs, can you keep up with me?

I will lock on love, I will lock on love
I will lock on love, I will lock on love

Go on your way, create those cries for Hell
I know that's what we want, I know it's a war we want
No one is left, so take it all yourself
I know that's what we want, I know it's a war we want

Showing up, showing up, an execution fulfilled
Their justice, corrupted, so ascent to torment
You're the same, you're the same
By blindly seeking honor
Your true nature comes out to play

We honor the jingos, oh
Weak or strong, carry on, show no mercy to them all
We are in the jungle, oh
Like an animal, we crave
Like a human that no one can save

Dance it up, ah-la-la
Dance it up, ah-la-la
Dance it up, ah-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Oh-Ah-Oh-Ah-Oh

Dance it up, ah-la-la
Dance it up, ah-la-la
Dance it up, ah-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Hurry up, I-ya-ya
Oh-Ah-Oh-Ah-Oh

The world will be colorful, painful, beautiful
When you are gone

We honor the jingos, oh
And the beast we unleash to indulge in our desires
We are in the jungle, oh
With our claws, a killing spree
With our fangs, can you keep up with –

The jingos
Tear them up just enough
Let the taste be put to test
We are in the jungle
Let our hunger never end
Let my savage brethren rise again

We honor the jingos, oh
We are in the jungle, oh
